  - Seeed Xiao ESP32S3
  - Wemos D1 Mini ESP32

- All communication is now **websocket based** and using flatbuffers, allowing for even lower latency between the server and the ESP, with lower resource consumption.
- The **Captive Portal** got a MASSIVE overhaul;
- Serial commands have gotten alot better.
- Improved board stability and configurability.
- Added support for having a E-Stop (emergency stop) connected to ESP as a panic button. Thanks to @nullstalgia ❤️
- And _much, much_ more behind the scenes, including bugfixes and code cleanup.
